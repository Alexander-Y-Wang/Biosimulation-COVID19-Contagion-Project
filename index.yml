  Network-Based Simulation Approach

abstract: Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread is crucial for the implementation of effective public health measures. 
  Particularly, quantifying the impact of quarantine - a common countermeasure - on disease progression can provide valuable 
  insights to guide public health policies. Through the implementation of a network model, we demonstrate that institutions of 
  varying degrees of quarantining can not only decrease the proportions of exposure and susceptibility to the pathogen COVID-19, 
  but extinguish infection faster.
