- File 1: project.mlx
    - This is a matlab live script file that houses the main code for our project. It will run through both replicated results from Hou et al. as well as our own created contact network for COVID-19 transmission. It utilizes another file called basic_model.m that is referenced later. 
- File 2: project.pdf
    - This is an exported pdf version of our live script project.mlx file. 
- File 3: index.yml
    - This file contains summary information about the project including title, authors, and abstract. 
- File 4: thumb.png
    - This image file represents the thumbnail for this project, which is a picture of COVID-19. 
- File 5: basic_model.m 
    - This matlab .m function contains the differential equations used in Hou et al. to simulate COVID-19 transmission in their SEIR model. It is used within project.mlx to properly simulate the transmission of COVID over a course of time.
- File 6: report.docx 
    - This word document is the report that was written for the project, titled: Modeling COVID-19 Spread and Management: Incorporating Age, Social Distancing, Mortality, and Hospitalization in a Network-Based Simulation Approach
